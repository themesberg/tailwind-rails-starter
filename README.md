[In this guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/rails/), you will learn how to set up Ruby on Rails with Tailwind CSS and install Flowbite to start using the UI components built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Create a new project

Follow the next steps to get started with a Ruby on Rails project and install Tailwind CSS and Flowbite. 

Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed on your machine before continuing.

1. Run the following command to install the `rails` gem from Ruby:

```bash
gem install rails
```

2. Create a new Ruby on Rails application if you don't already have one:

```bash
rails new flowbite-app
cd flowbite-app
```

Now that you have created a new project you can proceed by setting up Tailwind CSS.

## Install Tailwind CSS

Since Tailwind v4, it's really easy to install Tailwind CSS with Rails, because we no longer need to have a custom `tailwind.config.js` file. Instead, everything is configured in your main CSS file.

1. Install the official `tailwindcss-rails` gems:

```bash
./bin/bundle add tailwindcss-ruby
./bin/bundle add tailwindcss-rails
```

2. Run the install command to set up the Tailwind configuration files:

```bash
./bin/rails tailwindcss:install
```

Now that Tailwind CSS has been successfully installed you can proceed by installing Flowbite.

## Install Flowbite

1. Install Flowbite by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install flowbite --save
```

2. Import the default theme variables from Flowbite inside your main `application.css` CSS file:

```css
@import "flowbite/src/themes/default";
```

3. Import the Flowbite plugin file in your CSS:

```css
@plugin "flowbite/plugin";
```

4. Configure the source files of Flowbite in your CSS:

```css
@source "../../../node_modules/flowbite";
```

### Turbo load support

Flowbite provides custom event listeners for turbo load support if you import the `flowbite.turbo.js` file. Check out the following guides to learn more how to integrate the JavasScript file that powers the interactive components with Importmap or ESBuild.

### Importmap

Importmap is the default way of handling JavaScript on Rails 7. In order to support turbo load from importmaps you have to pin the `flowbite.turbo.js` file from a CDN where the `turbo:load` event listeners are added instead of `load`.

1. Add the following line inside your `importmap.rb` file:

```bash
pin "flowbite", to: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.turbo.min.js"
```

2. Then you need to import `flowbite` inside your `application.js` file:

```javascript
import 'flowbite';
```

This will enable the interactive elements like dropdowns, modals, and navbars work by hooking the event listeners and actions to the data attributes whenever a new page is loaded in your application.

### ESBuild

If you use ESBuild to Bundle your JavaScript on Rails, you will need to import a version of Flowbite which supports the `turbo:load` event listeners instead of `load`. To do this **add the line below** to your `application.js` file:

```javascript
import "flowbite/dist/flowbite.turbo.js";
```

### Standard JS (no turbo)

If you decide not to use turbo load then you can follow these steps:

1. Run this command to pin Flowbite in your `importmap.rb` file:

```bash
./bin/importmap pin flowbite
```

2. Then you need to include Flowbite inside your `application.js` file:

```javascript
import 'flowbite';
```

### Include via CDN

Alternatively to all of the above you can also include the JavaScript via CDN:

```html
// include via CDN for turbo support
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.turbo.min.js"></script>

// include via CDN without turbo support
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@{{< current_version >}}/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

### Datepicker

Since the release of version `2.4.0` of Flowbite the Datepicker component is now part of the main package so you don't need to include `datepicker.turbo.js` separately. It will work out of the box.

### Versions prior to 2.4.0

In order to support turbo load from Ruby on Rails 7, you have to include the `datepicker.turbo.js` file either from NPM or CDN into your project.

Include the following JavaScript file to support the datepicker component:

```bash
pin "flowbite-datepicker", to: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.3.0/dist/datepicker.turbo.min.js"
```

Don't forget to also import it inside your `application.js` file:

```javascript
import 'flowbite-datepicker';
import 'flowbite/dist/datepicker.turbo.js';
```

## Building your project

Run the following command to start a local server and build the source files:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

This will create a local server and you will be able to access the pages on `localhost:3000`.

You can also run `rails tailwindcss:build` to compile Tailwind CSS.

## Create a homepage

First of all, you need to delete the default `index.html` file inside the `public/` directory and then follow these steps:

1. Create a new `pages/` directory inside the `app/views/` directory.
2. Create a new `home.html.erb` file inside the `app/views/pages/` directory.
3. Choose one of the components from Flowbite (ie. a tooltip) and copy-paste it inside the newly created file:

```html
<button data-tooltip-target="tooltip-default" type="button" class="text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800">Default tooltip</button>
<div id="tooltip-default" role="tooltip" class="absolute z-10 invisible inline-block px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white transition-opacity duration-300 bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-xs opacity-0 tooltip dark:bg-gray-700">
    Tooltip content
    <div class="tooltip-arrow" data-popper-arrow></div>
</div>
```

4. Create a new controller called `pages_controller.rb` inside the `app/controllers/` directory and add the following code inside of it:

```bash
class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def home
  end
end
```

5. Set the homepage as the root page inside the `routes.rb` file inside the `config/` directory:

```bash
root to: 'pages#home'
```

If you have run `./bin/dev` to start a local server you should see the changes on `localhost:3000/` and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS should work and the interactive components from Flowbite should also be functional.

## Rails starter project

We have released an open-source [Ruby on Rails project with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite](https://github.com/themesberg/tailwind-rails-starter) that you can use to get starter with a new project where we have showcased most of the components from Flowbite.
